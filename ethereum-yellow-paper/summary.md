# Trie

- When it comes to `Trie` datastructure, the important thing is the definition of the `TrieNode` structure.
- After defining the structure, give some time to go over it and think about the `Insert`, `Delete` & `Search` functionalities.
- Take a pen and paper and work around the CRUD operations for a Trie.
- Once the above step is done, then sit for coding, and you  will be amazed about your understanding of the `Trie` datastructure and at the same time be wondered about the beauty of datastructures.
- If you understand the basics and fundamentals then programming becomes fun and an act of magic.
