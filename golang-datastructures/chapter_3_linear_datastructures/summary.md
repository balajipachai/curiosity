Datastructures allows vast swathes of data to be organized in a sequential and organized manner such as working with them is easy and efficient.

Linear datastructures:
- Lists
- Sets
- Tuples
- Stacks

# Lists

The most important aspect of lists (linked lists) is to understand how exactly the linking works. Try creating a mental map for the lists then
everything else becomes ice on the cake.

How do you create the mental map of linked list and it's linking?

- The answer is simple, take a pen and paper and try out the exercise for as long as you don't understand it.
- The happiness that you get after understanding is immense. (I have experienced it and hope that you too will experience it, given the time and effort you put in.)
- Try to get your head around `AddToHead` function, once you understand the linking their its as good as the entire singley linked list exercise of completing other functions such as `IterateList, LastNode, AddToEnd, NodeWithValue & AddAfter` are done.

# Doubly Linked List

- Repeating the same thing again, if you understand the linking in Linked list your life will become easy.
- Take a pen and paper and keep on working to understand the linking.
- Trust me it's not that hard however it isn't easy as well but it is doable. If I can, You Can too!

# Sets

Sets contain unique elements. IMO this is one of the simplest datastructures that I have come across. The different methods of Set includes
`New, AddElement, DeleteElement, ContainsElement, Intersection & Union`. If you have solved sets during your mathematics classes then you have an advantage if not then you should learn and implement.

# Queue

Queue works in First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order. The queue which we had implemented is the priority queue i.e. higher the priority earlier the element would be present in the queue. Imagine a queue to be a slice containing a structure. This structure has a priority field and depending on that the elements are inserted into the priority queue. Its simple all you have to know is the slicing operator and how to check for priority while inserting in the queue.
