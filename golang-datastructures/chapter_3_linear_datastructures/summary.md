Datastructures allows vast swathes of data to be organized in a sequential and organized manner such as working with them is easy and efficient.

Linear datastructures:
- Lists
- Sets
- Tuples
- Stacks

# Lists

The most important aspect of lists (linked lists) is to understand how exactly the linking works. Try creating a mental map for the lists then
everything else becomes ice on the cake.

How do you create the mental map of linked list and it's linking?

- The answer is simple, take a pen and paper and try out the exercise for as long as you don't understand it.
- The happiness that you get after understanding is immense. (I have experienced it and hope that you too will experience it, given the time and effort you put in.)
- Try to get your head around `AddToHead` function, once you understand the linking their its as good as the entire singley linked list exercise of completing other functions such as `IterateList, LastNode, AddToEnd, NodeWithValue & AddAfter` are done.
