# What I have learnt/understood from Chapter 1?

- This chapter begins with an introduction to some of the primitive datastructures such as Heap, List etc
- To use heap or list in Go, there are packages readily available, all you have to understand is how to make use them.
- As of now my understanding of `interfaces` implies they are everything in Go, i.e. if you don't know the type to use there you go `interfaces` coz every type implements the `empty interface {}`
- Structure in Go acts as Classes, you can define structures and add a `receiver function` in order to specify that they implement certain `interfaces`.
- This chapter also introduces some of the most common design patterns with code examples.
    - At present not all design patterns are clear however with time I will grasp the idea of each design pattern.
- The writer put forths certain questions to which answers will be found in the upcoming chapters such as Boyer-Moore, Ukkonnen and K-Way Merge algorithms.


`In my opinion one should first complete all the datastructures then target and learn about algorithms and only then go for problem solving.`

`As problem solving involves decision making, (algorithm comes handy over here).`

`Once you have identified the algorithm then select datastructure to use and solve the problem.`
