Properties of bitwise operations

- De Morgan's Law: ∼(a & b) = (∼a) | (∼b), ∼(a | b) = (∼a) & (∼b);
- Negative operation properties: -1 = ∼0, -a = ∼(a−1);
- AND operation properties: a & 0 = 0, a & (-1) = a, a & ( ∼a)=0;
- OR operation properties: a | 0 = a, a | (∼a) = −1;
- The result of a & (a−1) is to change the last 1 in the binary representation of a to 0;
- The result of a & (-a) is to keep only the last 1 of the binary representation of a, and set the remaining 1s to 0
