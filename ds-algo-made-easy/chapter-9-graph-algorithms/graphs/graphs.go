/*
Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm using PriorityQueue (Heap)
 1. Initialize distances of all vertices as infinite.
 2. Create an empty priority_queue pq.  Every item of pq is a pair (weight, vertex).
    Weight (or distance) is used  as first item  of pair, as first item is by default used to compare two pairs.
 3. Insert source vertex into pq and make its distance as 0.
 4. While either pq doesnâ€™t become empty
    ======> 1. Extract minimum distance vertex from pq.
    Let the extracted vertex be u.
    ======> 2. Loop through all adjacent of u and do the following for every vertex v.
    ======> 3. If there is a shorter path to v through u.
    ===========> 1.Update distance of v, i.e., do dist[v] = dist[u] + weight(u, v)
    ===========> 2. Insert v into the pq (Even if v is already there)
 5. Print distance array dist[] to print all shortest paths.
